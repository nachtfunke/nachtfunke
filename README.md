# hello yes, this is Thomas.

My Name is _Thomas Michael Semmler_ - I am a **CSS Developer & Designer**. I am currently focusing on Accessibility, Inclusive Design, Design Ops & Design Engineering. I'm somewhere in between. I am not a JavaScript Developer, though I do write presentational, (preferrably) Vanilla JavaScript.

Here's a few numbers that don't mean anything, but some ATS still look at it, so there you go:

## Previously Worked on:

easyname GmbH, ip-systems e.U., SAE Vienna (lecturer), LEAN-CODERS GmbH (Tech Evangelist)

## Currently Working on:

Many things! Mostly weird little non-SPA's that I enjoy making. Mostly eleventy probably! I currently find much joy in hand-writing SVG Code. I have a lot of opinions about the industrialization of webdesign & -development that I mostly share on [indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@nachtfunke)
